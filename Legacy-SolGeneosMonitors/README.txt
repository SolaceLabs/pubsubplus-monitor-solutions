Create your custom monitor configuration files under: 
Source/GenericMonitor/config
For each monitor you want to build and deploy.

Then:
Use ant to generate any and build all custom monitors using the build.xml file located in the Source directory.

Refer the Source/README for details on how to manually install the monitors onto the Solace appliance.
