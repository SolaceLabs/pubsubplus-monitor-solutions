# 2) VPN_METRIC_LIST - Resulting VPN table will have one row for each metric

# Define the data view name for all system monitors
# Proper convention is to use name of this file.

# SEMP makes uses the concept of iterators in order to return large lists of objects.
# The pageSize dictates the number of objects returned in each iteration.  In the
# case of sorted SEMP commands, only a single iteration will take place, so pageSize
# will limit the number of objects returned.
#
# Optional for the following monitor types:
#		VPN_OBJECT_LIST
#		SYSTEM_OBJECT_LIST
#
# Default:  500
#pageSize=100

# In order to reduce the load on both the netprobe, gateway and active consoles.  It
# is highly recommended that an upper limit be place on the number of objects that
# can be returned.  
#
# Optional for the following monitor types:
#		VPN_OBJECT_LIST
#		SYSTEM_OBJECT_LIST
# 
# Default:  500 
#maxObjects = 500

# If SEMP response contains a list of entries, a topic must be specified which
# identifies the start/end element for each entry.

#       VPN_OBJECT_LIST
#       SYSTEM_OBJECT_LIST
#
# 
#delimiterTopic=

#
# Topic which identifies the objects unique name or id.  Geneos expects the
# first column in each row to be unique, so a unique id/name for the object
# should be in the first column, this topic identifies where in the response
# to find the identifier.
#
#       - Wildcards are not supported
#	- ObjectIdTopic should not be among list of topics
#
#
# Recommended field for request types:
#       VPN_OBJECT_LIST
#       SYSTEM_OBJECT_LIST
#
#	If objectIdTopic is not defined, the columns will be in the order that
# topic matches are found.  Often the first metric in the semp response for
# objects is the name; however, if this is not the case, geneos will automtically
# rename the first column of each row to ensure they are all unique. 
#
#objectIdTopic=



# List of topics that are used to identify the elements from the SEMP response
# that will be placed in the Geneos table.  The user has the option to either
# use the tag name from the SEMP response or define their own name that will be used 
# to name the Geneos column (for OBJECT_LIST) or row (for METRIC_LIST) for the matching attribute.  Should a topic
# match multiple elements in the SEMP response.  The user MUST provide a unique name
# for each of the matching elements.  The order of the provided names will be preserved
# and applied to the matching elements in the order they are parsed.
#
# It is imperative that there are no duplicates column/row names.
#
# topic list format:  "topic1{columnList},topic2{columnList},...,topicN{columnList}"
# column/row list format: ":column1:column2:...:columnN"
#
#	- Wildcards are not supported

#	  between each subsequent column/row name.

#
# When the SEMP response contains objects within objects it is often
# useful to include the parent name among the attributes for the child object.
# The parent topic permits a single metric to be selected from the child's
# parent.  A name for the column may also be specified
#
# parent topic format: 		topic{columnName}
# column name format:		:name
#
# Example:
# parentTopic=rpc-reply/rpc/show/queue/queues/queue/name:queue-name
#
#
#parentTopic=


# Conditional topics permit filtering of unwanted objects.  Only objects for which
# the conditional topic resolves to true will be included in the geneos table.
#
# The conditional topic format:  topic:OPERATOR:RIGHT_OPERAND
# 	topic		- the object's attributue value that matches this topic will be used
#				as the left operand
#				- Wildcards are not supported
# 	OPERATOR	- supported operators are:
#					STR_EQUAL
#					STR_NOT_EQUAL
#					INT_EQUAL
#					INT_NOT_EQUAL
#					INT_GREATER_THAN
#					INT_LESS_THAN
# 
# Optional for the following monitor types:
#       VPN_OBJECT_LIST
#       SYSTEM_OBJECT_LIST
#
#conditionalTopic=
